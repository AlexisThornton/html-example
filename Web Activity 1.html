<h2>What Is Paprika Used For?</h2>

<body>
<p> I use Paprika for many things. I use it when seasoning soup and other dishes. <br/>
I use it most often when making seasoning for chicken tacos. <br/>
I use Paprika, as well as a variety of other seasonings, when I make seasoning for chicken tacos. <b><i>(I am going into more detail about this below.)</b></i> </p>

<h3><u>Seasoning for Chicken Tacos</h3></u> 

<i>This is the recipe I like to use, but you can find many different ones online.</i><br/><br/>
1&nbsp;tablespoon chili powder<br/>
1&nbsp;tablespoon garlic powder<br/>
1&nbsp;tablespoon onion powder<br/>
1&nbsp;tablespoon <b>paprika</b><br/>
1&nbsp;tablespoon crushed red pepper flakes<br/>
1&nbsp;tablespoon ground cumin<br/>
1&nbsp;teaspoon cayenne pepper <br/>
1&nbsp;teaspoon salt <i>(I like to use seasoned salt)</i><br/>
1&nbsp;teaspoon black pepper<br/>


<p>Depending on your taste (and amount of chicken you're making), you can add greater ( &gt;) or less (&lt;) than the amounts listed for each seasoning. </p?
